## Getting Started

### Step 1 - Create your cloud9 workspace.
Assuming you have created your [cloud9](https://c9.io/) account and are signed in, go ahead and create a new workspace by clicking on "create a new workspace".

## Step 2 - Clone iXperience's personal website template.

Once you click the following, you will be presented with a form. Make sure to give your workspace a name such as "Personal Website". The second step simply asks you if you would like your workspace to be public or private. This is up to you, but public will be fine for this. Next, you should see an optional input with the title: "Clone from Git or Mercurial URL (optional)". Go ahead and paste the following URL in there:
 ```
 https://github.com/iExperience/personal-webiste-template
 ```


Leave "choose a template" as it is and click "Create Workspace".

## Step 3 - Preview your website

You should now be presented with your development environment. This includes a tree-view of your project structure on the left and your open file in the middle. You're going to want to click "Run" on the top middle toolbar in order to start the server. This will spin up a web server so that you can view your website and start seeing your development changes in real time! Once you've clicked "run", give it a few seconds to start and then click "preview" and choose "live preview index.html". This will open up a new pane on the right and show you the website you are working on.

## Step 4 - Start building!

Now that you have your environment set up, go ahead and start playing around. Do your best and build a basic portfolio site that tells us more about yourself. It's okay if you are struggling! If you have questions, reach out on Slack and start honing your google ninja skills ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª.
